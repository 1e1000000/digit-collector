<h1>How to Play</h1>
Digit Collector is an incremental game featuring many prestige layers. This page will explain how to play the game.
<h2>Digits</h2>
You start with 10 0s. With these, you can buy a digit 0 that will produce 0s for you. You can buy multiple digit 0s to produce faster, but the cost increases each time.
<h2>Adding Digits</h2>
When you reach 1,000 0s, you can add digits. Adding digits will reset your progress to like it was was at the start of the game, but you will gain cbrt(0s/1000) pluses that you can spend on upgrades.
<h2>Digit Upgrades</h2>
You can spend pluses to upgrade your digits. Each upgrade makes the corresponding digit 2x (base) strnger. However, upgrades will increase in price, with higher digits generally increasing faster.
<h2>Digit Shifts</h2>
You can also spend pluses to upgrade more digits up to 9. These will produce higher numbers up to 9, but will provide a benefit to allow you to gain more pluses. THe pluses formula will changes to cbrt(0(1+0s/1000)*(1+1s/1000)*(1+2s/1000)*...)-1, for as many digits as you have unlocked. Each digit shift costs 4x more than the previous one, up to 9 total.
<h2>Multiply Numbers</h2>
When you reach 1 million pluses, you can multiply numbers to gain sqrt(pluses/1e6) crosses, while resetting everything before it in the game. You can spend these crosses to buy upgrades.
<h2>Number Upgrades</h2>
There are 9 number upgrades which cost different amounts of crosses. A couple of these upgrades can be bought as many times as you want. Each number upgrade has a different effect. Some unlock D.I.G.I.T.S. (see next section), while others provide more general boosts in progress.
<h2>D.I.G.I.T.S.</h2>
A D.I.G.I.T.S. (Direct Integration of Glyphic Integers Taken Spontaneously)[1] allows you to instantly automate an action. there are 3 D.I.G.I.T.S. in the game currently, unlocked as number upgrades.
